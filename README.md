# hello-world
this is the first project i am doing to learn github...


I am just a kid in school trying to get through life. My goal in life is to be successful, so passing school well can help ensure that. Maybe finding somebody to live life with along the way would be nice, but not much success with that right now so I am gonna see what kind of game systems they will come out with. So yeah, thats my very simple view on life right now
